- 👋 Hi, I’m Kristopher Curry. I've been studying and learning software engineering and computer science for four years now.
- 🏫 I am finishing my Computer Science B.S at UC Santa Cruz, and will then attend California State University Fullerton for my Masters degree in Computer Science.
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in C++ and C development, with a recentely aquired passion for system design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ formally, along with web development. I plan to combine these two intrests into a new project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I need to gain more experience with collaboration as my university did not present many opprotunities. 
- 📫 Please connect with me through my email, kristopher.curry@outlook.com.
